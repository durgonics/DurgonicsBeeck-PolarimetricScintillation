# Durgonics–Beeck Polarimetric GNSS Scintillation Formalism

This document summarizes the main ingredients of the formalism:

- Jones representation of ionospheric and surface effects
- Stokes–Mueller description and coherency matrix
- Faraday rotation, TEC, and retrieval of ⟨B\_∥⟩\_{Ne}
- Polarization scintillation index S\_pol = sqrt(Var[ψ])
- Frequency–geometry collapse Var[ψ] f⁴
- Tensor-inspired covariance and schematic L2D mapping
